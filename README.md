This is a modified version of @Ryan1408's Basic Boss Fight in Python 3 which is now in Node.js.

You can use this in vanilla javascript, if you modifed some of the code.

This program is easy to read and change with lots of comments to guide you around the code

If you are looking for a simple Boss Fight (in Node.js) that also looks nice, then this is for you!

If you are looking to change variables these are where to find them:

#modifiers = (lines 7 - 19) #random chances = (116 - 131)

To change the text go to the correct subroutine:

menu = menu() [line 21]

attack = attack() [line 33]

defend = defend() [line 56]

heal = heal() [line 62]

boss attack = battack() [line 71]

boss defend = bdefend() [line 88]

boss heal = bheal() [line 104]
